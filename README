INTRODUCTION
------------

Synth is a development environment for building hypermedia applications that are modeled 
according to SHDM (Semantic Hypermedia Design Method). It provides a set of modules that 
receive, as input, models  generated in each step of SHDM and produces, as output, the 
hypermedia application described by these models. Synth also provides an authoring environment 
that facilitates the adding and editing of these models through a GUI that can run on 
any web browser. 

Synth was built as the implementation task for the master thesis of 
Mauricio Henrique de Souza Bomfim on Informatics at PUC-Rio. 

It is on very early stage. Use Synth advised that you can find some bugs. 
If you find some bug, please report.
