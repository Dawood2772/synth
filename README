INTRODUCTION
------------
Synth is a development environment for building applications that are modeled 
according to SHDM. It provides a set of modules that receive, as input, models 
generated in each step of SHDM and produces, as output, the hypermedia application 
described by these models. Synth also provides an authoring environment that 
facilitates the adding and editing of these models through a GUI that can run on 
any web browser.
